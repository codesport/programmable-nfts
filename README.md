This NFT DAO meets the needs of  members of the blockchain ecosystem. This includes end users, investors, and blockchain developers.  

Endusers want to move beyond defi apps and apply blockchain to other use cases. Investors want to fund teams of ethical, honest, and productive developers. And Developer's we want to to be fairly compensated and work on projects we're passionate abpt

This phase deliverable is a proof of concept for the Investor NFT.  It can be minted on-demand by anyone wants to invest in a group of blockchain devs working together as a team.  

## Defining the Stake Holders

1. **End users** are anyone who wants a blockchain application for their particular use case or business need.  
2. **Investors** are obvious. They expect an eventual profit and return on capital risked. Professional investors also want to invest in proven teams who are honest and ethical!
3.  **Developers** are people like me who can build apps but are often burndened by endusers who think apps get built for free.

## Give the Stakeholder What They

1. **End users** to be able to crowd fund and support the applications they want built.
2. **Investors** with patient capital gain access to profitable investment vehicle and have a claim on all assets and profits generated by the DAO. This includes access to any future dividends and returns of capital
3. **Independent, open source, and freelance** developers are be fairly compensated nd rewarded for their work

## How Funds Are Allocated

80 to 90% of the funding provided by end users goes into developer salaries to fund product development.  The remaining 10% to 20% is kept in the treasury’s rainy-day reserve fund.

Investors are purchasing equity ownership in the DAO. They have a direct claim on all the assets based on their ownership percent. They pay a 5%-10% haircut which goes into the Treasury’s rainy-day reserve fund.

Developers get salaries and milestone bonuses based on building applications that end-users want and within schedule. Developers are also eligible for ownership awards based team member and end user feedback.

**Treasury funds:** The rainy-day fund will be used to fund developers’ salaries and living expenses when business is slow. Funds may also be invested in conservative fixed income strategies from Element Finance or Ethereum  token staking

## Next Steps
Test Governance token functionality with Tally. Deploy minter to a live website via vercel or heroku
In the near future, money spltitting/streaming will be added to this NFT so as to payout dividends or any excess earnings to owners.  
The below roles are simplied for discussion purposes. It’s understood that each stakeholder may have multiple roles.
